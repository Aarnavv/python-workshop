# NOTE: THIS IS NOT EXCEPTION HANDLING -> anticipate an error before it arises

# WILL DISCUSS FEW SYNTAX ERRORS

# 1. NameError
number = 5
print(num)

# 2. TypeError
a = input("Enter")
b = a + number
print(b)


# 3. ValueError -> we'll discuss while doing the Math module
# 4. IndexError -> we'll discuss later
# 5. ZeroDivisionError -> self explanatory


# should be done in 5 minutes
